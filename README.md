# Crypther: Classic Cipher Website

Crypther is a website designed to help you protect the privacy of your digital information. It offers classic tools to both encrypt and decrypt text and files.

- Encryption: Encryption converts your readable data into a scrambled, unreadable format. This prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing your content without the correct decryption key.
- Decryption: Decryption reverses the process, turning the encrypted data back into its original, readable form.
